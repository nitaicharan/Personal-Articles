## Personal essay

In my opinion the first step of recycling start, after people collecting and selecting which product kind, from collecting. This step should be taken by Government and property institutions to care out it, selecting and use those recycled products as feedstock for and create others build .

- One of the possible reasons people don't recycle wast materials is a lack of government awareness campaigns about it.

- Public structure to collect the recycle materials
- People culture

- Government campaigns in favor of recycles
- Government investment in collect recycle materials
