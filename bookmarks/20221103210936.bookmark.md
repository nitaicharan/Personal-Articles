### Overview
Overall, seafood imports tripled over that twenty-year period, with the top three countries controlling more than two-thirds of the market in the United States. In the future, however, import levels are forecast to shrink.

#### Explanation
- `seafood imports tripled over that twenty-year period`
  - this date was calculated between imports between `1996` and `2016`
- `that twenty-year period`
  - Replaces the word `years` in the introduction in order to not repeat it again
- `with the top three countries controlling more than two-thirds of the market in the United States`
  - This bring the pie graph to show the most imported countries from
  - Again we can calculate that it was two-thirds
- `In the future, however, import levels are forecast to shrink`
  - This a reference to the forecast in the first chart of year 2026
  - This forecast will be again distinguished in the body paragraph (it's a introduction to next paragraph)
  - `Imports level` replaces `imports` adding variety to vocabulary
- Both charts are summarised all informations in both charts

#### Tips
- Always start with word `Overall`
- We can always make some calculation based in charts to illustrate view points
- It's up to taste maker to add overview before or after body paragraphs
- Overview is the most important paragraph of essay

## Body paragraph 1
The US seafood imports increased from about $6 billion in 1986 to over $10 billion in 1996. Over the following ten years, that amount doubled and crossed the $20 billion mark in 2016. Despite the past growth, it is predicted that the trend will change and in 2026 the United States will receive approximately $2 billion fewer seafood products from abroad than it did in 2016.

#### Explanation
- `... in 1986 ... in 1996. ...` 
  - `Over the following the years` replaces the above sentence
  - In case of principal work try to use alternatives to replace it
- `that amount doubled` / `the trend will change`
  - Replaces seafood imports doubled / imports will decrease
- `Despite the past growth`
 - Link and preview to examiner that something will be approached about the preview

## Body paragraph 2
In regard to the geographical split of imports, the three countries that dominated the market in 2016 were China, Thailand, and Canada, which respectively imported 28 per cent, 23 per cent, and 16 per cent of the seafood. The imports from other countries - including Indonesia, Vietnam, and Ecuador - constituted one-third of the total annual seafood imports.

#### Explanation
- `IN regard to the geographical split of imports`
  - Link the previous body paragraph and make a sense of flow between both paragraphs
  - It also show what this paragraph is about of
  - Also smoothly transit between paragraph 
- `China, Thailand, and Canada`
  - Talk about the 3 most important countries (highers numbers)

### Tips
- Do not describe and name all data (countries) of charts
- Only select larges data in charts (China, Canada, Thailand)
- To have more words you can describe, in general, all smallest data (countries)
