[Data visualization](https://dzone.com/articles/6-ways-data-visualization-can-change-your-company) is required for the UI/dashboard of any program that focuses on data. It can be challenging to create accurate charts and infographics, but fortunately, many JavaScript libraries are available. However, there can be an overwhelming variety of options, each with advantages and disadvantages. You can use this article to choose a JavaScript data visualization library and learn more about its features.

Here are the most important factors to consider while choosing the right JavaScript data visualization library for your project. 

## Compatibility With Browsers and Devices {#compatibility-with-browsers-and-devices dir="ltr"}

One of the most important indicators of an effective data visualization library is its accessibility to everyone. This can be accomplished in two ways: first, by having an easy-to-use interface, and second, by being accessible across all platforms. You can choose a solution with a fully responsive design and mobile compatibility. 

## Versatility of Tools {#versatility-of-tools dir="ltr"}

Data preparation is the first functionality that must be covered for proper data processing to provide meaningful visualizations with genuinely helpful information. Advanced and predictive analytics are also crucial for data visualization libraries to maximize your data and improve your ability to predict the future.

## Capacity for Data Processing {#capacity-for-data-processing dir="ltr"}

Establishing that the chosen solution can give an optimal performance while managing a significant amount of data is important. Pay special attention to how well a data visualization library can manage multiple sources. The tool must be able to import any type of file and quickly connect to different databases. 

## Adaptability for Every Need  {#adaptability-for-every-need dir="ltr"}

Every business has unique requirements and qualities. So, it is good to find a flexible solution that can change to meet the needs of a specific company. Additionally, a decent data visualization tool must be adaptable to the organization\'s industry. For example, retail businesses don\'t have the same requirements as financial experts or government agencies.

## Convenient Exporting {#convenient-exporting dir="ltr"}

If you are creating dashboards for business users, they might want to export their data and charts to PDF or images. It will be ideal if the data visualization library you use has an export function built in from the start.

## Helpful Support {#helpful-support dir="ltr"}

When you encounter a problem, you may want outside assistance to overcome it. Support might take many different shapes, such as personal consultation, tech support, or community forums. The majority of general questions are already answered in popular data visualization libraries through documentation, tutorials, or FAQ sections.

These are some well-known data visualization libraries that would be a wonderful asset to any data-intensive application.
