need in one place. It can range from FAQs about your product/service,
common issues and their solutions, videos with tutorials on how to do
things and more.

Professional Look

### Blow away customers by how great it looks

Your customers deserve a professional looking knowledge base.
Sure, you can publish your Notion page on its own but it might
come across as
**unprofessional** with the messy Notion url, distracting links
pointing to Notion and the lack of customizability.

We
went the extra mile, optimized HelpKit for all devices and
**designed** it so beautifully, that your customers will get
blown away.

Custom Domain

### Connect your custom domain

subdomain of our pretty helpkit.so domain such as

piedpiper.helpkit.so

Make it match your brand by connecting your own subdomain so that
it looks like

support.piedpiper.com

work and learn from the ones that that do.
