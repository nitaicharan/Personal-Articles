### Get faster response time with a leader in edge development

Leverage the power of the world’s fastest, most reliable serverless compute platform to build and run modern apps at the edge — because speed matters. By moving your latency-sensitive workloads to the edge, get faster response times and, ultimately, better user experiences.

> “Compute@Edge is giving us another layer of control over the CDN so we can modify responses and optimize the delivery of each request. Our business is ensuring that the customer always gets the fastest response they possibly can. To make that happen, we needed the ability to run code inside the CDN itself. Fastly's Compute@Edge gives us that.”
