    ## Install Homebrew
    
    The script explains what it will do and then pauses before it does it. Read about other [installation options](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation).

    ## What Does Homebrew Do?
    
    Homebrew installs [the stuff you need](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/) that Apple (or your Linux system) didn’t.
    
- 
    
    Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into `/usr/local` (on macOS Intel).
    
    `$ cd /usr/local
    $ find Cellar
    Cellar/wget/1.16.1
    Cellar/wget/1.16.1/bin/wget
    Cellar/wget/1.16.1/share/man/man1/wget.1
    
    $ ls -l bin
    bin/wget -> ../Cellar/wget/1.16.1/bin/wget`
    
- 
    
    Homebrew won’t install files outside its prefix and you can place a Homebrew installation wherever you like.
    
- 
    
    `$ brew create https://foo.com/bar-1.0.tgz
    Created /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/bar.rb`

    It’s all Git and Ruby underneath, so hack away with the knowledge that you can easily revert your modifications and merge upstream updates.

    `class Wget < Formula
      homepage "https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"
      url "https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.15.tar.gz"
      sha256 "52126be8cf1bddd7536886e74c053ad7d0ed2aa89b4b630f76785bac21695fcd"
    
      def install
        system "./configure", "--prefix=#{prefix}"
        system "make", "install"
      end
    end`

    Homebrew complements macOS (or your Linux system). Install your RubyGems with `gem` and their dependencies with `brew`.
