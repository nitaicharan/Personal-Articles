## “Best practices” don’t actually work.

- I have no design skills and with Tailwind I can actually make good looking websites with ease and it's everything I ever wanted in a CSS framework.
- I started using @tailwindcss. I instantly fell in love with their responsive modifiers, thorough documentation, and how easy it was customizing color palettes.
- I've been using @tailwindcss the past few months and it's amazing. I already used some utility classes before, but going utility-first... this is the way.
- After finally getting to use @tailwindcss on a real client project in the last two weeks I never want to write CSS by hand again. I was a skeptic, but the hype is real.
- I didn't think I was going to like @tailwindcss... spent a day using it for a POC, love it! I wish this had been around when we started our company design system, seriously considering a complete rebuild
- My first tailwind project worked great but what really kicked ass was going back to it months later and saving so much time making new changes. I knew how everything fit together instantly.
- Tailwind is a classic example of why you need to put preconceptions aside when evaluating tech. The experience and productivity is streets ahead of what you might have believed based on old school CSS thinking!
- TailwindCSS is a framework like no other. Rather than constraining you to a set design, it gives you the tools and the standardization to build exactly what you want.
- I remember being horrified the first time I saw utility first css. But these past months using Tailwind on an increasing number of projects has just been a joyful new way to build things on the web.
- I was initially skeptical as I began using @tailwindcss, until I now needed to copy a @sveltejs component to a different location and I didn't need to worry about any of my styles breaking.
- Awesome stuff! I'm no designer or front-end developer; until I found Tailwind last year I hadn't done any CSS since the early nineties. Tailwind, and Tailwind UI mean I can now create good looking front ends quickly, which is super empowering. Crazy impressive project.
- I admit I was a big skeptic of @tailwindcss until last year. I thought "why would I ever type a million classes that just abstract single CSS properties?" By now, I feel like I'm twice as productive when building UIs. It's really amazing.
- I'm nearing completion on my months-long project of rewriting my company's frontend in TypeScript and @tailwindcss. Still, every time I re-implement a component, I think, "Wow, that was way easier this time." Tailwind rocks.
- With the amount of shipping we have to do, skipping the conversion of brainwaves to CSS, and being able to implement at the speed of thought using Tailwind, my life as a fullstack developer has never been more blissful.
- Tailwind makes it easy to bring new developers into the frontend project without having to worry about the mental exercise of understanding ‘some’ developer’s class hierarchy and thought process behind it.
- Tailwind has been a total game-changer for our dev team. It allows us to move faster, keep our UI consistent, and focus on the work we want to do instead of writing CSS.
- Have been working with CSS for over ten years and Tailwind just makes my life easier. It is still CSS and you use flex, grid, etc. but just quicker to write and maintain.
- I’ve been writing CSS for over 20 years, and up until 2017, the way I wrote it changed frequently. It’s not a coincidence Tailwind was released the same year. It might look wrong, but spend time with it and you’ll realize semantic CSS was a 20 year mistake.
- I came into my job wondering why the last dev would ever implement Tailwind into our projects, within days I was a Tailwind convert and use it for all of my personal projects.
- Tailwind made me enjoy frontend development again and gave me the confidence that I can realize any design - no matter how complex it may be.
- Tailwind CSS has alleviated so many problems we've all become accustomed to with traditional CSS that it makes you wonder how you ever developed websites without it.
- Having used other CSS frameworks, I always come back to Tailwind CSS as it gives me the ability to create a consistent and easy to use design system in my projects. Thanks to Tailwind CSS I only need one cup of coffee to get started on a new project.
- I’ve been using TailwindCSS for many years, and yet they seem to still amaze us every year with the updates. It’s aided me in building websites super quickly, I could never go back to boring old CSS classes!
- Tailwind CSS is a design system implementation in pure CSS. It is also configurable. It gives developers super powers. It allows them to build websites with a clean consistent UI out of the box. It integrates well with any web dev framework because it‘s just CSS! Genius.
- It’s super simple to slowly migrate to Tailwind from e.g. Bootstrap by using its prefix feature. Benefiting from its features while not having to spend a lot of time upfront is amazing!
- Tailwind CSS helps you eject from the complexity of abstracting styles away. Having styles right there in your HTML is powerful, which gets even more obvious when using products like Tailwind UI.
- If Tailwind is like Tachyons on steroids, Tailwind UI is like Lance Armstrong winning the Tour de France (seven times). Without, of course, the scandal and shame.
- Being burned by other abandoned CSS frameworks, my biggest fear was to bet on yet another framework that may disappear. However, I gave it a try and couldn’t be happier. They keep improving the framework in meaningful ways on a regular basis. It feels very much alive.
- Getting buy-in on TailwindCSS from our entire team of developers took some time and discussion, but once we implemented company wide, it has made it a breeze for any developer to jump into any project and quickly make changes/enhancements.
- Tailwind CSS has at the same time made CSS enjoyable and drastically changed how I build out products. It's rapid, efficient and an absolute joy to work with.
- Using any CSS framework other than Tailwind seems like a step backward in web development at this point. Absolutely nothing else comes close to making me as productive during the design phase of development than Tailwind.
- Tailwind is like a really nice pair of socks. You think, “okay, how good can a pair of socks be”. Then you put socks on and you are like “%@#! these are socks”.
- Tailwind unified our css work across different client projects more than any other methodology, while letting us keep our bespoke designs, and even improved performance and stability of our sites.
- TailwindCSS has single-handedly been the biggest and most impactful change for our team's development workflow. I'm glad I live in a universe where Tailwind exists.
- Tailwind solves a complex problem in an elegant way. It provides a ready-to-use UI, all while not compromising on enabling developers to quickly build anything imaginable.
- I was bad at front-end until I discovered Tailwind CSS. I have learnt a lot more about design and CSS itself after I started working with Tailwind. Creating web pages is 5x faster now.
- Tailwind clicked for me almost immediately. I can't picture myself writing another BEM class ever again. Happy user since the first public release! Productivity is at an all time high, thanks to @tailwindcss.
- CSS has always been the hardest part of offering a digital service. It made me feel like a bad developer. Tailwind gives me confidence in web development again. Their docs are my first port of call.
- I thought "Why would I need Tailwind CSS? I already know CSS and use Bootstrap", but after giving it a try I decided to switch all my projects to Tailwind.
- If you work at an agency and deal with hundreds of unique sites, each of them having their own custom CSS is a nightmare. Do your future self a favor and use Tailwind!
- Before Tailwind CSS I was banging my head against the wall trying to make sense of my CSS spaghetti. Now I am banging my head against the wall wondering why I didn’t try it earlier. My head hurts and my wall has a big hole in it. But at least using CSS is pleasant again!
- After using Tailwind for the first time, I wondered why I used anything else. It's now my go-to CSS framework for any application, production or prototype.
- Tailwind not only made me able to focus on building great UI’s but it also improved my overall CSS skills by having such a wonderful docs site when I needed to handwrite CSS.
- Using Tailwind is an accelerant for rapid prototyping design systems. Strong documentation, helpful community, and instant results.
- I instinctively hated utility CSS, but Tailwind completely converted me. It reignited my excitement for front-end development and implementing custom designs!
- Tailwind CSS bridges the gap between design and dev more than anything else. It reintroduces context to development, limits cognitive load with choice architecture, grants access to a token library out of the box and is incredibly easy to pickup. It helped my design career so much.
- Going back to a large website that doesn't use Tailwind is like hopping out of a Tesla and into my dad's rusted Minnesota farm truck. Sure, it works, but the clutch is slipping, the brakes barely work, and it's filled with old tires we're not even using anymore.
- I pushed back hard at the mention of Tailwind initially due to the number of classes in my code however within 5 minutes or using it I was hooked and now am the annoying guy pushing Tailwind on anyone who will listen. It has simplified my dev workflow beyond measurement.
- I never bothered to learn vanilla CSS because it’s a waste of time — why bother when I have Tailwind instead? Turns out I learned a ton of CSS anyway just by using Tailwind. It’s such a perfect middleground between thoughtful abstraction, while still letting you break free.
- Tailwind and the ecosystem around it is like a giant turbocharger for web agencies. It helps teams of developers and designers develop a shared language and system of constraints that speeds up the entire process. It's a game-changer for efficient teamwork.
- Tailwind provides the style of bespoke design, the constraint of a design system, and the flexibility to make it infinitely customizable, without being shoehorned into making every website look like it was cut from the same cloth.

An API for your design system.

Utility classes help you work within the constraints of a system instead of littering your stylesheets with arbitrary values. They make it easy to be consistent with color choices, spacing, typography, shadows, and everything else that makes up a well-engineered design system.

## Build anything

Build whatever you want, seriously.

Because Tailwind is so low-level, it never encourages you to design the same site twice. Even with the same color palette and sizing scale, it's easy to build the same component with a completely different look in the next project.

## Performance

It’s tiny — never ship unused CSS again.

Tailwind automatically removes all unused CSS when building for production, which means your final CSS bundle is the smallest it could possibly be. In fact, most Tailwind projects ship less than 10kB of CSS to the client.

## Mobile-first

Responsive everything.

Wrestling with a bunch of complex media queries in your CSS sucks, so Tailwind lets you build responsive designs right in your HTML instead.

Throw a screen size in front of literally any utility class and watch it magically apply at a specific breakpoint.

This sunny and spacious room is for those traveling light and looking for a comfy and cosy place to lay their head for a night or two. This beach house sits in a vibrant neighborhood littered with cafes, pubs, restaurants and supermarkets and is close to all the major attractions such as Edinburgh Castle and Arthur's Seat.

Hover and focus states? We got ’em.

Want to style something on hover? Stick `hover:` at the beginning of the class you want to add. Works for `focus`, `active`, `disabled`, `focus-within`, `focus-visible`, and even fancy states we invented ourselves like `group-hover`.

## Component-driven

## Dark mode

Now with Dark Mode.

Don’t want to be one of those websites that blinds people when they open it on their phone at 2am? Enable dark mode in your configuration file then throw `dark:` in front of any color utility to apply it when dark mode is active. Works for background colors, text colors, border colors, and even gradients.

Tailwind includes an expertly crafted set of defaults out-of-the-box, but literally everything can be customized — from the color palette to the spacing scale to the box shadows to the mouse cursor.

Use the tailwind.config.js file to craft your own design system, then let Tailwind transform it into your own custom CSS framework.
