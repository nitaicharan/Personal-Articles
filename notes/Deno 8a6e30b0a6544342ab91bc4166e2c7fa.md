Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly that uses V8 and is built in Rust.

1. Provides [web platform functionality](https://deno.land/manual/runtime/web_platform_apis.md) and adopts web platform standards.
2. Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled.
3. Supports [TypeScript](https://deno.land/manual/typescript) out of the box.
4. Ships only a single executable file.
5. Has a set of reviewed (audited) standard modules that are guaranteed to work with Deno: [deno.land/std](https://doc.deno.land/https://deno.land/std).

### [Installation](https://deno.land/#installation)

Deno ships as a single executable with no dependencies. You can install it using the installers below, or download a release binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases).

PowerShell (Windows):

```
$
```

See [deno_install](https://github.com/denoland/deno_install) for more installation options.

```
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts";serve(req => new Response("Hello World\n"));
```

You can find a more in depth introduction, examples, and environment setup guides in [the manual](https://deno.land/manual).

### [Runtime Documentation](https://deno.land/#runtime-documentation)

The basic runtime documentation for Deno can be found on [doc.deno.land](https://doc.deno.land/deno/stable).

Deno comes with [a manual](https://deno.land/manual) which contains more in depth explanations about the more complex functions of the runtime, an introduction to the concepts that Deno is built on, details about the internals of Deno, how to embed Deno in your own application and how to extend Deno using Rust plugins.

The manual also contains information about the built in tools that Deno provides.

### [Standard Modules](https://deno.land/#standard-modules)

Next to the Deno runtime, Deno also provides a list of audited standard modules that are reviewed by the Deno maintainers and are guaranteed to work with a specific Deno version. These live in the [denoland/deno_std](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std) repository.

These standard modules are hosted at [deno.land/std](https://deno.land/std) and are distributed via URLs like all other ES modules that are compatible with Deno.

### [Third Party Modules](https://deno.land/#third-party-modules)

Deno can import modules from any location on the web, like GitHub, a personal webserver, or a CDN like [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/), [jspm.io](https://jspm.io/), [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) or [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/).

To make it easier to consume third party modules Deno provides some built in tooling like `[deno info](https://deno.land/manual/tools/dependency_inspector)` and `[deno doc](https://deno.land/manual/tools/documentation_generator)`. deno.land also provides a web UI for viewing module documentation. It is available at [doc.deno.land](https://doc.deno.land/).

deno.land also provides a simple public hosting service for ES modules that work with Deno. It can be found at [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x).

### [Built-in Toolchain](https://deno.land/#toolchain)

Deno comes with a robust [set of tools](https://deno.land/manual/tools), so you can spend less time searching and evaluating third party modules, and more time writing code and being productive. Here are a few examples.

[Lint](https://deno.land/manual/tools/linter) all JS/TS files in the current directory and subdirectories:

[Format](https://deno.land/manual/tools/formatter) all supported files in the current directory and subdirectories:

```
$deno test https://deno.land/std@0.132.0/testing/chai_example.tsrunning 3 tests from https://deno.land/std@0.132.0/testing/chai_example.tstest we can make chai assertions ... ok (8ms)test we can make chai expectations ... ok (2ms)test we can use chai should style ... ok (4ms)
test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out (27ms)
```
