## Setup

First, letâ€™s make sure that your development environment is ready.

- If you donâ€™t have **Node.js** installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Youâ€™ll need Node.js version **10.13** or later.
- Youâ€™ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.

> If you are on Windows, we recommend downloading Git for Windows and use Git Bash that comes with it, which supports the UNIX-specific commands in this tutorial. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is another option.

### Create a Next.js app

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, `cd` into the directory youâ€™d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"
```

> Under the hood, this uses the tool called `create-next-app`, which bootstraps a Next.js app for you. It uses this template through the `--example` flag.
> 
> 
> If it doesnâ€™t work, please take a look at [this page](https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/blob/master/basics/errors/install.md).
> 

### Run the development server

You now have a new directory called `nextjs-blog`. Letâ€™s `cd` into it:

```bash
cd nextjs-blog
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts your Next.js appâ€™s "development server" (more on this later) on port **3000**.

Letâ€™s check to see if itâ€™s working. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) from your browser.
