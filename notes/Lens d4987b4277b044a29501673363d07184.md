At CLASTIX we use it. Recommended. We have been early adopters of Lens and always recommend it to our customers.

This is fantastic, good to know about Lens.. being able to control k8s through a GUI is really awesome.

Been using Lens for a while now, can't imagine doing my job without it, keep up the great work.

I've shared it already, but I want to say again that I'm real happy I found [@k8slens](https://twitter.com/k8slens) for Kubernetes work. Makes it much more convenient, especially when juggling multiple clusters!

Here's a nice and free desktop app that will help you visualize and control your Kubernetes cluster(s). üê≥

I know how overwhelming managing a k8s cluster can be. You can get quickly lost in the command line.

Here comes Lens, the IDE for Kubernetes. Link is in the reply üëá

I love Lens. It‚Äôs very clean, easy to use, and provides great information at a glance! Congratulations!

I'm loving it! The best universal tool for Kubernetes. It is like finally having eyes in Kube world. Easy to spot divergencies from normal and then use different tools to deepdive.

I have to say I've really been enjoying [@k8slens](https://twitter.com/k8slens) to help track events across my cluster when running [@projectsonobuoy](https://twitter.com/projectsonobuoy) e2e testing #k8s #Kubernetes #e2etesting

Today I just discovered [@k8slens](https://twitter.com/k8slens) and I am blown away how helpful this tool is. The open source community is amazing!

Can't imagine working without [@k8slens](https://twitter.com/k8slens) again. It saves so much time when debugging. Awesome tool! #Kubernetes

k8s Lens [https://k8slens.dev](https://k8slens.dev/) has become an indispensable tool for me to get a quick overview of workloads on kubernetes across clusters

Hijacking this to say [@k8slens](https://twitter.com/k8slens) is excellent and really helped me grok and love my kube clusters
