## KrakenD is a stateless, distributed, high-performance API Gateway that helps you effortlessly adopt microservices

## The API Gateway pattern at its full extent

KrakenD is more than a typical proxy that forwards clients to backend services, but a powerful engine that can transform, aggregate or remove data from your own or third party services. KrakenD also implements the **Backend for Frontend** and **Micro-frontends** patterns to eliminate the necessity of dealing with multiple REST services, isolating clients from the micro-service implementation details.

How KrakenD works

## The fastest API Gateway in the market

**+70,000 requests/second** on commodity hardware

### Built for performance

KrakenD's **stateless architecture** and performance-first approach for every internal component beat any API Gateway in the market.

Our customers with massive usage face the networking limits while KrakenD still keeps a low consumption of resources.

But don't take our word for granted, do your own benchmarks.

## Get started in 5 minutes

Edit the configuration file and run the service, as a daemon or as an agent. Don't like editing text files? No problem, use the visual [KrakenDesigner](https://designer.krakend.io/).

### Create endpoints at a click

All KrakenD endpoint configuration is stored in a plain text `.json` configuration file. You can edit this file by hand or design your API interface visually using the KrakenDesigner.

Everything you need to run the server:

`krakend run --config krakend.json`

The command will start the http daemon serving all the endpoints you defined in the configuration file.

"I've chosen KrakenD because of its simplicity, statelessness, immutability, and performance."

"KrakenD represents a renaissance of innovation and investment in the API gateway and management space by challenging the established players with a more lightweight, high performance, and modern gateway for API publisher to put to work across their API operations, while also continuing to establish the Linux Foundation as the home for open API specifications and tooling that are continuing to touch and shape almost every business sector today"

"I'm excited to hear that KrakenD framework is being brought into the family of open source projects managed by the Linux Foundation. I believe this shows the global community the commitment KrakenD has to keeping their technology open source and free to use. With the adoption that already exists, and this new promise towards the future, I expect amazing things for the product and the community around it."

"At Hepsiburada we have a massive amount of traffic and a complex ecosystem of around 500 microservices and different datacenters. Adding KrakenD to our Kubernetes clusters has helped us reduce the technical and organizational challenges of dealing with a vast amount of resources securely and easily. We have over 800 containers running with KrakenD and looking forward to having more."

"KrakenD allowed us to focus on our backend and deploy a secure and performant system in a few days. After more than 2 years of use in production and 0 crash or malfunction, it also has proven its robustness"

"KrakenD makes it easier for us to manage authentication, filter bots, and integrate our apps. It has proved to be stable and reliable since day one. It is wonderful!"

"The Opensource model always was a great proof of innovation and nowadays a synonym of high-quality products and incredible attention with the real needs from the market (Customer Experience). The Linux Foundation is one of the catalysts of incredible solutions, and KrakenD and now Lura would not have a better place to be. With this move, I am sure that it is a start of a new era for this incredible solution in the API Gateway space, the market will be astonished by a lot of good things about to come."

"We have implemented KrakenD and I must say that I am very impressed how easy the installation and configuration process has been. The documentation is one of the best I have ever seen."

"KrakenD is working on our production environment like a charm. Its documentation is well structured and comprehensive at once; so we were able to discover and activate new features without any difficulties."

"Flexibility, performance and robustness are defining KrakenD just to name a few, we were able to quickly and easily build a robust gateway for our systems and we keep enjoying it everyday."
