I’m a big proponent of NFTs. Yeah, they’re stupid. But a lot of things in real life are stupid.

But you know, I mostly support NFTs as in ‘non-fungible tokens’ part. Not the blockchain part.

So I was thinking. Maybe, surely, someone would find a use for the blockchain that is genuinely useful. But the more I thought about it the more I realized: no, no one is going to ever find a use for this technology.

Because it is fundamentally problematic. And here’s why.

## They’re Inefficient

So there have been a few anti-cryptocurrency videos going around. Most notably ‘Line Goes Up’. The above one is by ‘münecat’. Pronounced ‘munecat’. Yeah, I’m not really sure what’s the point of the accent. I’m still looking into that.

It’s pretty good. And there’s inexplicably a stripper hoop for some reason.

Anyways the main part starts with this:

> Blockchain technology is a bit like: imagine there was a really easy quick way of making payments called, IDK, Visa, right? But you thought, “Hey, why don’t we replace this system with something else that doesn’t involve a middleman”, right? Because that’s a problem that needs solving. And replace it with a system that uses more electricity than the Netherlands.
> 

So that’s the problem with blockchains in a nutshell. And don’t say, “Hey, proof of work is actually good for the environment.” No, it’s not:

The fundamental problem is inherent in the blockchain: every node needs to approve every transaction. That means it’s slow and expensive to run. Anything a blockchain can do a real database like AWS Aurora… RDS, Redshift, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, Redis, DocumentDB, Keyspaces, Neptune, Timestream, or Ledger, for 1/1000x the cost. At least.

Did you see when Ethereum gas fees went over $3000 the other day:

This is the future! So efficient.

So anything you do on a blockchain can be better done with a normal centralized database. So I do not understand why anyone would want to use a blockchain to do this stuff.

## They’re Insecure

You know I heard the other day someone saying how Bitcoin and Ethereum have never been hacked. And I responded something like, “Yeah, except that one time when Ethereum was hacked and they had to roll back the changes and all the individual exchanges, but I guess those don’t count.”

I’m not even going to talk about the fact that someone can just choose to roll back a currency. Imagine if the Fed was like, “There was a really bad stock market crash on Thursday so we’re just going to roll back all the transactions on Thursday and pretend that never happened.”

Well, at least now Bitcoin and Ethereum are safe, right? Or at least Cordano with its mathematical proofs. Well yes, but actually no.

Every blockchain is vulnerable to an attack called a 51% attack. Simply put the way these blockchains work is by proof of ‘x’. The more ‘x’ you have the more voting power you get. So if you have 51% of all the ‘x’ you have majority voting rights over the entire network.

Now you may say, “A 51% is purely hypothetical, it can never happen.” Really? Well, there are certain companies that are fairly big and make money from mining/staking the currency. They’ve been known to approach this 51% figure. I think one company in China may have even passed it once.

The only reason they haven’t done it yet is because such an attack would throw the entire cryptocurrency into turmoil and undoubtedly result in the attacker losing money.

And many blockchains are switching to proof of stake, meaning all you need to do is prove you hold 51% of the currency to launch this type of attack which is even easier to do. Because most of the time the insiders hold most of the coins. Over 50% in many cases.

And what if a nation-state tries to attack a cryptocurrency. They can easily acquire a large stake and do whatever they like.

## Conclusion

And this isn’t even touching on the other problems with cryptocurrencies. Like how every transaction is publicly visible. It’s a privacy nightmare.

Now proponents will say, “But governments can’t block it.” No, governments can block it because it uses the internet. Now, it could be harder to block than, say, Visa, but it can be done.

Blockchain tech does nothing better than a simple database. It is inherently flawed. It is an inherently inferior technology. This is not to say cryptocurrencies don’t have good ideas. It’s just that the technology they use is… colossally inefficient.

Wait. Before you go why not give this article a clap or two.
