The OpenJS Foundation is made up of 32 open source JavaScript projects including Appium, Dojo, Electron, jQuery, Node.js, and webpack. Our mission is to support the healthy growth of JavaScript and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.

Thanks to the interconnected nature of the JavaScript ecosystem, our scope covers a broad range of projects that represent a massive and diverse developer and end user community. While hosted projects will be our main focus, the benefits of the OpenJS Foundation will extend to non-hosted projects as well. Our goal is to make it easy and straightforward for projects to join the OpenJS Foundation and take advantage of our technical and community governance templates. In addition, companies that depend upon JavaScript are invited to join as members, providing tangible support and direction in activities that benefit the entire ecosystem.

The OpenJS Foundation is the central place to support collaborative development of JavaScript and web technologies. Interested in joining? Learn more about [membership benefits and how to join](https://openjsf.org/about/join/)!
