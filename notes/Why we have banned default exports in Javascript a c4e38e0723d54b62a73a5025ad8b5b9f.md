*ES2015* was the most important improvement to Javascript in years. Among many great features it brought brand new module system ‚Äî *Ecma Script Modules* which finally solved the problem of sharing code between files (modules) on a language level. It was a huge step forward but it needed to work with already existing modules, especially CommonJS used by node (*require*). That‚Äôs why it required some compromises, one of them is the existence of default exports. In this article, I want to explain why here at [Neufund](https://neufund.org/), we decided to ban default exports and use solely named ones.

ESM are part of ES6 (ES2015)

## Better DX

Default exports don‚Äôt export any name ie. symbol that can be easily associated with a exported value. Named exports, on the other hand, are all about having a name (pretty obvious right üòÇ) . This makes possible for IDEs to find and import dependencies for you automatically, which is a huge productivity boost.

How cool is that?

## Refactoring

Default exports make large-scale refactoring impossible since each importing site can name default import differently (including typos).

```
// in file exports.js
export default function () {...}// in file import1.js
import doSomething from "./exports.js"// in file import2.js
import doSmth from "./exports.js"
```

On the contrary, named exports make such refactoring trivial.

## Better tree shaking

Sometimes you can be tempted to export one huge object with many properties as default export. This is an anti-pattern and prohibits proper tree shaking:

```
// do not try this at home
export default {
  propertyA: "A",
  propertyB: "B",
}// do this instead
export const propertyA = "A";
export const propertyB = "B";
```

Using named exports can reduce your bundle size when you don‚Äôt use all exported values (especially useful while building libs).

## Summary

Default exports were introduced mostly for easier interoperability with thousands CommonJS modules that were exporting single values like:

```
module.exports = function() {...}
```

They don‚Äôt bring many benefits when used internally in your codebase, so please avoid them and thus make world a better place üòÅ
