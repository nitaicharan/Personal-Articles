## Metadata

What if we wanted to modify the metadata of the page, such as the `<title>` HTML tag?

`<title>` is part of the `<head>` HTML tag, so let's dive into how we can modify the `<head>` tag in a Next.js page.

Open `pages/index.js` in your editor and find the following lines:

```tsx
<Head>
  <title>Create Next App</title>
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
</Head>
```

- How to modify the metadata of the page?
    
    Notice that `<Head>` is used instead of the lowercase `<head>`. `<Head>` is a React Component that is built into Next.js. It allows you to modify the `<head>` of a page.
    
    You can import the `Head` component from the `[next/head](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head)` module.
    

### Adding `Head` to `first-post.js`

We haven't added a `<title>` to our `/posts/first-post` route. Let's add one.

Open the `pages/posts/first-post.js` file and add an import for `Head` from `[next/head](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head)` at the beginning of the file:

```tsx
import Head from 'next/head';
```

Then, update the exported `FirstPost` component to include the `Head` component. For now, we‚Äòll add just the `title` tag:

```tsx
export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>First Post</title>
      </Head>
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Back to home</a>
        </Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  );
}
```

Try accessing [http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post](http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post). The browser tab should now say ‚ÄúFirst Post‚Äù. By using your browser‚Äôs developer tools, you should see that the `title` tag is added to `<head>`.

> If you want to customize the `<html>` tag, for example to add the `lang` attribute, you can do so by creating a `pages/_document.js` file. Learn more in the [custom `Document` documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document).
