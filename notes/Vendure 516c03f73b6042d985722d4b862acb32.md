Vendure is a new e-commerce framework built for the developers who are building the modern web.

Loved by developers. Powering high-growth start-ups. Trusted by Fortune 500 enterprises

### Flexible. Composable.

Vendure is a **headless commerce framework**, meaning that it delivers content through its [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/), leaving you free to implement your store-front applications in the technologies of your choice.

Tailor your application by composing best-in-class services and APIs, with Vendure at the core.

### Made for Developers

Vendure makes **developer productivity** a top priority. The framework is written in TypeScript and is built on the npm ecosystem.

The combination of TypeScript and GraphQL provides **end-to-end type safety**.

### Open Source

Vendure core is available under the [MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license). All development of the core framework is being done **in the open** on [GitHub](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure).

No lock-in to a proprietary platform.

> At KLEKT we chose Vendure after many painstaking hours of competitive research. Being a marketplace we didn't feel like there was anything out there that really fit the bill out of the box, but with an API-first platform and the ability to create custom plugins we were able to extend Vendure to meet our needs. In comparison to other platforms Vendure is much lighter, fully utilises modern technologies and doesn't need 25 dev ops engineers to make it scale. So for us it seemed the right fit and we haven't looked back.
