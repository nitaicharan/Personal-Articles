### CPU Anomaly Detection

Identify CPU anomalies taken with a more accurate detection method.

- Provides an overview of your applications' performance across all or a subset of connected processes, when a specific process has at least one active worker thread, the process will be highlighted.
- Compare metrics across multiple processes is a reliable way to identify anomalies without false positives.

Identify Memory anomalies taken with a more accurate detection method.

- Insights and metrics historic, before and after the incident happened.
- Get anomalies at different heap usage levels.
- Detect correlation between sets of memory specific metrics.
- Filter results by specific processes inside your application.

### CPU Profiling

CPU Profiling allows you to understand where opportunities exist to improve the speed and load capacity of your Node processes.

- Capture and address performance bottlenecks that are inhibiting peak Node.js performance.
- Shows what functions consume what percent of CPU time. This information can provide you a better understanding of how your application is executed, and how exactly resources are allocated.

Worker Threads monitoring provides developers the ability to improve the performance of CPU intensive-work.

- Have in-depth metrics of each worker thread just as they have leveraged them previously on the main thread.
- Compare threads.
- Debug and find solutions for any problems while using threads in production.
- Seamless, integrated, with zero overhead, backwards compatible and includes CLI support.

### Capture Heap Snapshots

Taking heap snapshots is a great way to help identify the underlying problem when faced with a memory leak or performance issue.

- By looking at these snapshots, you can begin to understand where and how memory is being used.
- N|Solid provides several ways to capture snapshots: the N|Solid Console, the N|Solid CLI, and the N|Solid Node API.
- You can compare snapshots, which makes debugging memory leaks a snap.

### Vulnerability Scanning & 3rd-Party Modules Certification

The N|Solid Console can be configured to perform periodic verification of all packages loaded by all N|Solid processes.

- All loaded packages are verified against a list of known vulnerabilities.
- When new vulnerabilities are found, information about each vulnerability will be reported in the Console. Notification options can be configured.
- Provides actionable insights into the risk levels in your use of third-party packages.

### Global Alerts & Integrations

You can configure the N|Solid Console to notify you when new vulnerabilities are found in your applications.

- You can add Integrations to Slack, Microsoft Teams, email or Webhooks to be invoked when a new vulnerability is found.
