# **Introduction to Shipa**

- What is Shipa?
    
    Shipa is an Application Management Framework.
    
    Shipa abstracts the underlying cloud and Kubernetes infrastructure through a developer portal so developers can focus on application deployment and management rather than infrastructure-related objects and manifests. In contrast, platform engineering teams focus on implementing controls and policies for developers' applications and services using Shipa's developer portal.
    
    In short, Shipa is designed to make it simple for developers to run their code on Kubernetes without having to know Kubernetes and for platform engineers to enforce controls and policies.
