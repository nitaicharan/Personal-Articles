| OnPush: 0 | Use theÂ CheckOnce
Â strategy, meaning that automatic change detection is deactivated until reactivated by setting the strategy toÂ Default
Â (CheckAlways
). Change detection can still be explicitly invoked. This strategy applies to all child directives and cannot be overridden. |
| Default: 1 | Use the defaultÂ CheckAlways
Â strategy, in which change detection is automatic until explicitly deactivated. |
