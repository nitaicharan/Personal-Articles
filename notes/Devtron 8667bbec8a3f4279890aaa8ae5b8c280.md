## **Why** **we built devtron**

Enforcement and management of security policies is unwieldy. #SecurityPolicies debugging is #NotTopologyAware

Collaboration on helm charts across teams and environments is ineffective. #helmcharts are like #hydra, spawning two heads for every slain head

## Almost **impossible to achieve the optimal balance**  between Cost, Stability & Security.

Fine grained access control; control who can edit configuration and who can deploy.

## Sneak Peek into some exciting features

## Devtron is built on some of the most trusted and loved technologies

## We’re starting to transform the way you DevOperate

Devtron has been our go-to tool for deployment on Kubernetes for more than a year now. Single pane view for application debugging has improved the stability of our applications, and deployment metrics has helped us measure our deployment frequencies. We are making automated deployments without any hassle.

With over 400 consumer groups, we wrote and managed our own python script for deployment via Jenkins. Features like Linked CI and Deployment Groups in Devtron enabled us to deploy any number of applications with shared codebase together for downstream deployments. Ability to Clone Apps allowed us to create new applications with a single click. Also, ability to Tail and Grep logs within Devtron helps to debug applications, check events and config in one screen without switching to cloudwatch.

Devtron has been instrumental in quick adoption of kubernetes at BharatPe. Our team was able to move more than 80% of our applications running on kubernetes in production clusters in less than 2 months without having to delve too much into learning kubernetes. This has lead to increased productivity of the devops team and they are able to contribute more in other areas.

No more messy manifests to manage. We at Devtron, manage all our Deployments and Helm charts for all the clients and environments right from Devtron dashboard with proper role based access control for the entire Team. We deploy across multiple clusters at just a click of a button.
