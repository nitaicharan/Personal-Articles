“InfluxDB has a very awesome stack, which gave us everything we needed when constructing the system.”

“InfluxDB is a high-speed read and write database. So think of it. The data is being written in real time, you can read in real time, and when you’re reading it, you can apply your machine learning model. So, in real time, you can forecast, and you can detect anomalies.”

“We didn’t have a great way to figure out and quickly diagnose what endpoint was driving that problem… That’s how we started thinking about monitoring APIs. And that’s what led us down this journey with InfluxData.”

“As Wayfair has grown and matured its software development and data center operations over the past decade, and particularly over the last five years, we have embraced the principle of providing maximum visibility into our processes and systems.”

“InfluxDB has become our go-to database choice. Often if we are using a different tool, we figure out how to get data out of the tool into InfluxDB. It’s easier to use, performs better, and is cheaper.”

“InfluxDB is the most powerful technology to fit the moment. We can store a lot of metrics and manipulate them in real time.”
