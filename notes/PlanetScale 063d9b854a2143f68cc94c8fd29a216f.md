Great read, this is partly why we’re building on **@planetscaledata** so that we have sharding from the get-go with no additional effort

**PlanetScale** is a masterclass in building for developers:

🤯Brilliant solution for a very real problem. Delightful. ✨Beautiful. 🎯Functional. ⛔️No BS. 💝Generous free tier so you can really explore the value.

talking to the lovely @isamlambert about **@planetscaledata**

"this platform will have the greatest beauty to functionality ratio ever”

no pressure, then, sam. to be fair he is showing me some cool shit.

Three companies and websites I look for best-practices in the dev tool space:

- Stripe 
- **PlanetScale** 
- WorkOS

New post: From Firebase/Redis to MySQL with **PlanetScale** ✨

Learn how I migrated my Next.js site to use MySQL with **@planetscaledata**, resulting in 10x faster response times for my APIs.

I’ve been on **@planetscaledata** long enough to shill with 100% confidence.I moved round.t3.gg from RDS PSQL over to **PlanetScale** with... 0 downtime? Unreal. DX has been great for onboarding devs too. Oh, also - scale is insane. $0.35 charged so far. 🙏
