See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

I use a rigid commit message format, and it makes me a better programmer.

```
feat: add hat wobble

^--^ ^------------^
| |
| +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.

```

## More Examples

```
chore: add Oyster build script
docs: explain hat wobble
feat: add beta sequence
fix: remove broken confirmation message
refactor: share logic between 4d3d3d3 and flarhgunnstow
style: convert tabs to spaces
test: ensure Tayne retains clothing

```

## That’s It

You’ll never again be tempted to include a bug fix and a feature in the same commit. My git log is now an easy-to-skim changelog.

Inspired by [Karma’s commit style](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/dev/git-commit-msg.html).
