So far, the Next.js app we created only has one page. Websites and web applications generally have many different pages.

Let's explore how to add more pages to our application.

## What You’ll Learn in This Lesson

In this lesson, you will:

- Create a new page using the integrated [file system routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).
- Learn how to use the `[Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link)` component to enable client-side navigation between pages.
- Learn about built-in support for code splitting and prefetching.
