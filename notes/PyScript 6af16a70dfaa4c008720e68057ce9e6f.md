PyScript is a framework that allows users to create rich Python applications in the browser using HTML’s interface. PyScript aims to give users a first-class programming language that has consistent styling rules, is more expressive, and is easier to learn.

## What is PyScript? Well, here are some of the core components:

- **Python in the browser:** Enable drop-in content, external file hosting (made possible by the [Pyodide project](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), thank you!), and application hosting without the reliance on server-side configuration
- **Python ecosystem:** Run many popular packages of Python and the scientific stack (such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and more)
- **Python with JavaScript:** Bi-directional communication between Python and Javascript objects and namespaces
- **Environment management:** Allow users to define what packages and files to include for the page code to run
- **Visual application development:** Use readily available curated UI components, such as buttons, containers, text boxes, and more
- **Flexible framework:** A flexible framework that can be leveraged to create and share new pluggable and extensible components directly in Python

All that to say… PyScript is just HTML, only a bit (okay, maybe a lot) more powerful, thanks to the rich and accessible ecosystem of Python libraries.

In short, our mission is to bring programming for the 99%.
