### Built for engineering teams

*"The engineering effort of writing tests for just one of our microservices was going to be 2+ Engineering weeks in JMeter, versus the Â½ day it took us in k6!"*

### What our users are saying

[Iâ€™ve been trying a bunch of different tech lately for load testing and man nothing comes close to how good](https://twitter.com/nickchapsas/status/1457025419492970500) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) is

[@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) thank you for creating an amazing open source product. I wrote my own thread ripper for load testing and you just saved my socks with the integration tools you have by default. Anyone looking to do load testing highly recommend using k6. It also reminds me of snowboarding.

[I'm 90% complet on my](https://twitter.com/G0GMANGO/status/1323349882581602304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#PoC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PoC?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and in my professional opinion [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) is definitely a [#gamechanger](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamechanger?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) for [#performance](https://twitter.com/hashtag/performance?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#testing](https://twitter.com/hashtag/testing?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) allows [#shiftleft](https://twitter.com/hashtag/shiftleft?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) excellent [#docs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/docs?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) support 4 [#Docker](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Docker?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#javascript](https://twitter.com/hashtag/javascript?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) custom [#metrics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/metrics?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and establish [#thresholds](https://twitter.com/hashtag/thresholds?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) to pass/fail [#cicd](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cicd?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) builds for both [#webui](https://twitter.com/hashtag/webui?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) & [#API](https://twitter.com/hashtag/API?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

[I've toyed with a few load testing tools over the years, but only today tried](https://twitter.com/brettflorio/status/1359367762011824131?s=20) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), and wow, is it pleasant to use. Haven't tried the hosted version, but for quick and easy CLI stuff, absolutely wonderful.

[Toying around with](https://twitter.com/WyriHaximus/status/1137809103525470208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) tonight. Pretty impressed with how easy it is to set up (yay [@Docker](https://twitter.com/Docker?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)!) and to start building test scripts. Some early results: [pic.twitter.com/LGCESvFMlv](https://t.co/LGCESvFMlv)

[I love products like](https://mobile.twitter.com/josefrichter/status/1471105376300982274) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) - very technical and geeky domain, yet the product is extremely user friendly and you can understand and start using it within *seconds*, not even minutes. Great job.

[personally using](https://twitter.com/tottiLFC/status/1018895382359789570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and its has helped us quite a lot already. Definitely worth adding to your testing pipeline.

[Lately I have been using](https://twitter.com/ShradhaKhard/status/1245900269042483201) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) for performance testing the RESTful APIs we build and I simply fell in love with it. It so simple and easy to use, i highly recommend it!!

[Loving](https://twitter.com/VamseeKonda/status/1242213455085649921) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) for integrating perf tests into [@AzureDevOps](https://twitter.com/AzureDevOps?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) pipelines. Great documentation, easy to use..

[So](https://twitter.com/morrisoncole/status/1262604136626786305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) is probably my new favourite tool. Super quick to get set up and running load tests ðŸ˜»

[For anyone interested in load / stress testing, Iâ€™ve been using](https://twitter.com/milaw/status/1284872490444038150?s=20) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) recently and has been an absolute pleasure. Script up your flow using JS and away you go. Load tests in source control FTW. API for build sever runs too, beautiful.

[Holly Molly, using](https://twitter.com/braybaut/status/1284174380625526784?s=20) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) to do stress test and send the metrics to [#DataDog](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataDog?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) on real time, amazing tool.
Open source and written in [#golang](https://twitter.com/hashtag/golang?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

[Yesterday was awesome! I whipped up a](https://twitter.com/lhojgaard/status/1374361583120433153?s=20) [@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) extension in [@golang](https://twitter.com/golang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) so my load tests can publish to [@nats_io](https://twitter.com/nats_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Took about an hour and a half and the end result was 57 lines of Go :D [#golang](https://twitter.com/hashtag/golang?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

[.](https://twitter.com/aboodman/status/1391840744021762051?s=20)[@k6_io](https://twitter.com/k6_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) is pretty nice new load testing tool for APIs.
Feels very modern and professionally built compared to a lot of tools I've used in this space.
