The easiest way to write to files in Node.js is to use the `fs.writeFile()` API.

Example:

```jsx
const fs = require('fs');

const content = 'Some content!';

fs.writeFile('/Users/joe/test.txt', content, err => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
  // file written successfully
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the synchronous version `fs.writeFileSync()`:

```jsx
const fs = require('fs');

const content = 'Some content!';

try {
  fs.writeFileSync('/Users/joe/test.txt', content);
  // file written successfully
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```

You can also use the promise-based `fsPromises.writeFile()` method offered by the `fs/promises` module:

```jsx
const fs = require('fs/promises');

async function example() {
  try {
    const content = 'Some content!';
    await fs.writeFile('/Users/joe/test.txt', content);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
example();
```

By default, this API will **replace the contents of the file** if it does already exist.

You can modify the default by specifying a flag:

```jsx
fs.writeFile('/Users/joe/test.txt', content, { flag: 'a+' }, err => {});
```

The flags you'll likely use are

- `r+` open the file for reading and writing
- `w+` open the file for reading and writing, positioning the stream at the beginning of the file. The file is created if it does not exist
- `a` open the file for writing, positioning the stream at the end of the file. The file is created if it does not exist
- `a+` open the file for reading and writing, positioning the stream at the end of the file. The file is created if it does not exist

(you can find more flags at [https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system_flags](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system_flags))

A handy method to append content to the end of a file is `fs.appendFile()` (and its `fs.appendFileSync()` counterpart):

```jsx
const content = 'Some content!';

fs.appendFile('file.log', content, err => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
  // done!
});
```

Here is a `fsPromises.appendFile()` example:

```jsx
const fs = require('fs/promises');

async function example() {
  try {
    const content = 'Some content!';
    await fs.appendFile('/Users/joe/test.txt', content);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
example();
```

All those methods write the full content to the file before returning the control back to your program (in the async version, this means executing the callback)

In this case, a better option is to write the file content using streams.
