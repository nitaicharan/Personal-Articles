## CSS Styling

Let‚Äôs now talk about **CSS styling**.

As you can see, our index page ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)) already has some styles. If you take a look at `pages/index.js`, you should see code like this:

```
<style jsx>{`
  ‚Ä¶
`}</style>

```

This page is using a library called [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx). It‚Äôs a ‚ÄúCSS-in-JS‚Äù library ‚Äî it lets you write CSS within a React component, and the CSS styles will be *scoped* (other components won‚Äôt be affected).

Next.js has built-in support for [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx), but you can also use other popular CSS-in-JS libraries such as [styled-components](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-styled-components) or [emotion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-emotion).

### Writing and Importing CSS

Next.js has [built-in support for CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) and Sass which allows you to import `.css` and `.scss` files.

Using popular CSS libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss) is also supported.

In this lesson, we‚Äôll talk about how to write and import CSS files in Next.js. We‚Äôll also talk about Next.js‚Äôs built-in support for [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) and [Sass](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support). Let‚Äôs dive in!
