## Editing the Page

Let’s try editing the starter page.

- Make sure the Next.js development server is still running.
- Open `pages/index.js` with your text editor.
- Find the text that says **“Welcome to”** under the `<h1>` tag and change it to **“Learn”**.
- Save the file.

As soon as you save the file, the browser automatically updates the page with the new text:

![Editing%20the%20Page%20360d9b53393b4159b5e93a994ab080fc/learn-nextjs.png](Editing%20the%20Page%20360d9b53393b4159b5e93a994ab080fc/learn-nextjs.png)

The Next.js development server has [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) enabled. When you make changes to files, Next.js automatically applies the changes in the browser almost instantly. No refresh needed! This will help you iterate on your app quickly.

### Next Up: Creating Pages

Great job! That’s it for the first lesson.

In the next lesson, we’ll talk about *creating more pages and navigating between pages*.

> You should keep the development server running, but if you want to restart it, hit Ctrl + c to stop the server.
