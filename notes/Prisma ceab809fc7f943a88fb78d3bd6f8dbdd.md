Prisma helps app developers **build faster** and **make fewer errors** with an open source database toolkit for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB and CockroachDB.

## Data model you can read

Central to Prisma is the **schema** - a declarative way to define your app's data models and their relations that's human-readable. And you don't have to painstakingly create it from scratch if you already have a database - `prisma introspect` takes care of that.

Prisma Client is a query builder that composes the way you think and gets auto-generated from the Prisma schema with types tailored to your app. We designed the API to be intuitive for both SQL veterans and people brand new to databases.

Based on the Prisma Schema, Prisma Migrate automatically generates SQL database migrations, that are fully customizable. For quick data model prototyping in development,`prisma db push` lets you make changes to the database without generating migration files.

The easiest way to explore and manipulate data in your Prisma projects. Understand your data by browsing across tables and their relations and edit them with safety. Available for macOS, Windows and Linux.

## How does Prisma fit into your stack?

Prisma is a **server-side** library that helps your app read and write data to the database in an intuitive and safe way.

Easy to integrate into your framework of choice, Prisma simplifies database access, saves repetitive CRUD boilerplate and increases type safety. It's the perfect database toolkit for building robust and scalable web APIs.
