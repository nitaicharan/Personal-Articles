The second page we added currently does not have styling. Let's add some CSS to style the page.

Next.js has built-in support for [CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) and [Sass](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support). For this course, we will use CSS.

This lesson will also talk about how Next.js handles static assets like images and page metadata like the `<title>` tag.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn in This Lesson

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn:

- How to add [static files](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving) (images, etc) to Next.js.
- How to customize what goes inside the `<head>` for each page.
- How to create a reusable React component which is styled using [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css).
- Some useful tips for styling in Next.js.

### Prerequisites

- Basic CSS knowledge. This course will go over how to add CSS in a Next.js app, but it won't cover CSS fundamentals.
