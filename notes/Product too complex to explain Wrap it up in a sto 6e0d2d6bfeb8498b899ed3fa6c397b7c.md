## What we learned from applying the age-old technique of storytelling to a highly technical project

*Written by content designer Jane Palash and staff content designer Dana Young.*

Ok, let’s talk storytelling. Before your eyes roll too far back in your head, stay with us. Just because the word gets thrown about so much that you hear it in every TED talk, doesn’t mean that it doesn’t work. In fact, it gets thrown about so much *precisely* because it works. It will always work, it’s innate to human interaction.

As designers, [we employ storytelling in our work all the time](https://ux.shopify.com/what-tv-taught-me-about-design-presentations-8fd77f167be6), whether we are aware of it or not (journeys, personas). We often leave those techniques on the whiteboard as the thinking *behind* our work, not the work itself. Or, maybe we’re really winning on that front, but just for our focused part of the experience, such as discovery or onboarding. But have you noticed that far too often the story fades past the CTA?

Narrative is almost only used for certain discipline audiences and is mostly tied to marketing. That’s a massively overlooked opportunity. Some audiences, like engineers, never get to see the story. It’s not in the technical documentation and product deep-dives.

Maybe this exchange sounds familiar to you? “This seems complicated…,” says anyone on your UX team. “It’s for developers,” someone clarifies.

Yes, we are all in awe of our colleagues’ superhuman ability to process complex information and bring our ideas to life. Yes, there are ways in which we know this audience prefers information to be presented. However, a clear-cut narrative ties all the elements together, makes them engaging, easier to follow, and lends the highly-satisfying feeling of *coherence* to the product.

We had a chance to try this technique and connect all the dots in a single narrative in our most recent project: the launch of Marketplace Kit—a partner guide to building commerce across any platform using Shopify.

## The story of the Marketplace Kit

Building commerce into your platform is not a task for the faint of heart. It’s a tedious, expensive, time-consuming undertaking that takes months, if not years, of planning and work, which is why most platforms are turning to pre-built offers that they can neatly sew into their existing applications and web experiences.

Shopify was able to offer a package deal to those who were seeking to get commerce on their surfaces: software *and* merchants. We connected with the platforms and helped build the integration, thus giving our merchants another outlet to sell. It was a win-win. Almost.

Over the years of building integrations for partners like Google and Facebook, we’ve noticed quite a few things were left to be desired. For one, each integration looked different. For our merchants, the experience of selling with Google was nothing like selling with Walmart or Pinterest. Not only that, but to build the integration we had to keep in constant contact with the partner team, and sometimes go as far as creating a whole unit within Shopify dedicated specifically to working with that partner. The more partners had joined the more obvious it became — the setup was unsustainable. We can’t spin up a team for each partner but we also can’t let them wing it.

A concept was floating in the air: we needed a guidebook with enough information for partners to build an integration on their own. Even better, a complete guide to building commerce on any platform using Shopify.

The vision behind this and the potential it held could hardly be overestimated. As we talked about it in our team huddles, a dizzying idea of all commerce in the world running on Shopify software in the future seemed less and less of a pipe dream. If we could offer our partners the most competitive package with clear instructions on how to build every feature they might want, from simple product ads to markets with thousands of sellers, we might turn the whole notion of a marketplace upside down. After a few pivots and brainstorming sessions, we landed on the most self-explanatory name for our project, *Marketplace Kit*.

Yes, the pixel art is our official Shopify brand. Yes, we’re hiring.

# “You get a marketplace, and you get a marketplace!”

Two main questions remained: how do we organize it and how do we explain what it is to the people who might want it. We needed a good story for each.

First, we needed a sales pitch that would encompass our unusual offer: “Here’s a set of documents and APIs that allow you to build commerce on almost anything that runs on ones and zeros. Oh, and also on the other end of that bridge, 1.7 million Shopify merchants ready to sell on your platform.”

The trickiest part of it was that the pitch we’d end up with was supposed to appeal to all: CEOs, CTOs, engineers, business devs, and anyone else involved in the decision to partner up with Shopify. In a tightrope walk we tried to balance out technical information with marketing appeal, selling and explaining at the same time.

Second, we needed to build story.

Devs seem like an unlikely audience but, in fact, they turned out to be the perfect fit. They love skimming through, learning quickly, following and unpacking complex ideas. And no better way to do it than with a story!

The answers required:

1. What do devs think of when they start building a marketplace?
2. How do we explain the build journey and all of our internal jargon to an external audience who’s outside of Shopify context?
3. What can we offer at the time of launch, and what should be included in the future versions?

Now, in the spirit of transparency, we’re going to admit that all three questions took more time to get answers to than any of us had intended. We’ll go over lessons learned a little later, and focus on the challenges at the moment.

## **Organizing the information**

Our initial approach was to have it all in one place, like a hub with both marketing and development info, and maybe a few outgoing links to more extensive tutorials. All of it was supposed to be housed on a stand-alone website. This allowed for a separate brand, a clear narrative, and a convenient user journey: from the homepage all the way down to UX and engineering tutorials.

![Product%20too%20complex%20to%20explain%20Wrap%20it%20up%20in%20a%20sto%206e0d2d6bfeb8498b899ed3fa6c397b7c/1Lu0AAIgJVbLOZ14vXr4l4g.png](Product%20too%20complex%20to%20explain%20Wrap%20it%20up%20in%20a%20sto%206e0d2d6bfeb8498b899ed3fa6c397b7c/1Lu0AAIgJVbLOZ14vXr4l4g.png)

First, raw wires that explored keeping all the info in one place.

Naturally, an array of technical and product constraints floated up once we started fleshing out the project, so a few sliding-puzzle-style iterations later we landed on two entities:

[A separate tab in our developer docs hub.](https://shopify.dev/marketplaces)

The divide had its pros and cons. On one hand, we didn’t need to align the audience this much, as the information on the landing page could be focused on marketing, while the dev parts could be much more technical. On the other hand, there is a high chance that the same audience will travel from one surface to the other and thus the change in tone and narrative must be seamless, even though the information itself might vary. In other words, the same story and the same vision must unite both pieces of content.

## **Explaining the build journey**

While the marketing efforts were focused on presenting the offer and outlining the business value, the dev docs needed a step-by-step path for building ‘anything your heart desires’. Unlike most of our development documentation, Marketplace Kit had a much more complicated task in front of it: it needed to be flexible enough to allow for customizable commerce experiences, depending on what the partner wants, all while giving very exact and easy-to-follow instructions on how to get there. *Choose your own adventure—*but make it engineering.

We also had to marry our usually opinionated design system with external platforms. We could easily be prescriptive when it came to our own admin, so giving ready UI components to build the Shopify-bound part of the integration was easy. Providing enough flexibility in the visuals and behaviors of the features that were going to be buyer-facing on the partner platform is where it got interesting.

Our made-up MockingBird marketplace

To solve this, we had content and product designers join forces with technical writers to create a narrative around the build outcome. We called it the MockingBird Marketplace. In simple terms, it was a sample marketplace, designed to showcase what can be done and how it could look. We also employed multiple colorful diagrams with our branded pixelated art to light up the road ahead for devs and visualize complex notions, such as the structure of a marketplace. At a glance, it’s really hard to understand where some processes happen and who carries them out, so the visuals helped map it out easily.

We’re standing by the idea that technical info doesn’t need to look dreadful.

Defining the scope was one of the hardest things for a team that wanted it all and preferably by yesterday. We knew that some of the things we dearly wanted to offer, such as a multi-merchant cart, were not built by our engineers at that point but hope made us dreamy, so we struggled to scope down for some time. Finally, after a few dead darlings, we committed to a slimmer MVP and moved ahead with it. The storytelling part of this challenge lay in giving the right amount of future promise in all of our content, while making it clear that those features were not available just yet.

# **Learnings**

## 1. Equalize your story across the team

Our stakeholders believed in different things. It took us a while to notice that the vision of the product and of its final shape were different in the minds of our stakeholders. Some were unaware of our current technical capabilities, some thought our offer was different, some had particular audiences in mind. We, the UX team, jumped right into designing and you can guess the kind of feedback we got. We struggled to adjust our work and failed to see that what needed to be adjusted was the shared vision, a shared *story*.

**Suggestion:** Make people spell out their vision and expectations, so the discrepancies are obvious from the start and could be addressed. Never assume people think the same.

## 2. Don’t move forward with missing requirements

We’re often told by inspired people with hands-free microphones, strolling across conference stages, that we need to learn to work with unknowns.

“You need to dive in, lean into the discomfort!” they’ll tell you.

We did, all the way. Maybe a little too far. We leaned so far into working with multiple unknowns, that it turned out counterproductive. The team was so excited to deliver the Marketplace Kit, that no one wanted to be the one to pause, assess the situation, and realize that we’re missing key pieces to design a good product. We weren’t in early contact with the documentation hub team; we weren’t aware that we’ll be unable to send paid traffic there; we thought we’d have a couple more APIs ready. All of these gaps could’ve been identified and solved quickly, if caught early.

**Suggestion:** Have the will to make everyone stop and think for a second, even if it means pausing the progress of the project.

## 3. Treat your teammates as an audience

Being out of context is a basic human right. It might be natural to you to assess the time and information required to put together a wireframe and flesh out the content. It’s also tempting to assume that everyone else knows it too, even if they’re an engineer, a marketing manager, or a product director. So you end up very conflicted about why you’re asked to deliver designs or content pieces with completely ambiguous requirements, or asked to change things in a way that seemingly doesn’t make sense.

**Suggestion:** Spend a few minutes explaining the logic and order of the design process. Treat stakeholder reviews as a chance to situate your work within the story, show where you came from and where you’re going, and remind the team of a broader context. This, plus an explicit set of expectations on the type of feedback you need, can help you move forward.

## 4. Define the form and structure of the feedback

“The book can be revised indefinitely. Set a date and publish.”

As much as we’d love to accommodate everyone’s opinion, there comes a point in every project, where you need to pull a good-old, “Your call is very important to us.” Not because that opinion matters less but simply because you need to move forward. *Disagree and commit* is yet again the only possible way to progress. Marketplace Kit had quite a few moments where a stricter RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix could’ve saved us hours of discussion and days of work.

If you find yourself in a position with 10 stakeholders, each with a strong opinion, and you know that all of them expect to be heard and have their feedback addressed, don’t try to cater to everyone. Outline the feedback, identify the conflicts, ask the Responsible and Accountable to resolve them.

**Suggestion:** Have senior-level support and a clear matrix of responsibility. Have a consistent deadline, even if it’s not justified by anything external. Have a consistent body of stakeholders or a single person who gets to make key decisions. If any of these statements are not true, bring it up and address them.

## **How the story ends**

Marketplace Kit has launched and, as of November 2021, every platform in the world can build commerce on their surface. TikTok has a shopping tab and Spotify is selling merch, all is well in the world. And every developer who reads through our documentation and supporting materials can enjoy the story and the vision of what they can build.

Bottom line is: narrative creation is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal. Use it to tie together all the parts of a product, from discovery to technical documentation. Having a story makes it easy to explain the product to external and internal. It’s a universal concept, tried and tested by millenia, loved and understood by all.
