## Cypress App

### Install Cypress and write tests locally.

[Installing Cypress](https://on.cypress.io/installing-cypress) is simple. No dependencies, extra downloads, or changes to your code required.

[Write tests](https://on.cypress.io/writing-your-first-test) easily and quickly, and watch them execute in real time as you build your web application.

### Build up a suite of CI tests, record their results and gain powerful insights

Debugging your tests in CI is as easy as running tests locally. With built in parallelization and load balancing.

Record CI test results, screenshots and video - and view aggregated, next-level insights in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io/).

## Test your code, not your patience.

Cypress is the new standard in front-end testing that every developer and QA engineer needs.

### Developer-friendly

Cypress has been made specifically for [developers and QA engineers](https://www.cypress.io/how-it-works), to help them get more done.

Cypress benefits from our amazing [open source community](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) - and our tools are evolving better and faster than if we worked on them alone.
