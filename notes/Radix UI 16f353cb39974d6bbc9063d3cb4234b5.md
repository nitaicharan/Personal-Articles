Unstyled, accessible components for building highâ€‘quality design systems and web apps in React.

[Install Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/overview/getting-started)

With modal and non-modal modes, fine-grained focus control, accessible to screen readers.

It takes a *lot* of time to develop and maintain robust UI components, and it's mostly undifferentiated work. Building on top of Radix components will save you time and money, so you can ship a better product faster.
