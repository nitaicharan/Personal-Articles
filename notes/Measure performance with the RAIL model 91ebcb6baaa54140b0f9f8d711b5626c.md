**RAIL** is a **user-centric** performance model that provides a structure for thinking about performance. The model breaks down the user's experience into key actions (for example, tap, scroll, load) and helps you define performance goals for each of them.

RAIL stands for four distinct aspects of web app life cycle: response, animation, idle, and load. Users have different performance expectations for each of these contexts, so performance goals are defined based on the context and [UX research on how users perceive delays](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/).

The 4 parts of the RAIL performance model

## Focus on the user [#](https://web.dev/rail/#focus-on-the-user)

Make users the focal point of your performance effort. The table below describes key metrics of how users perceive performance delays:

User perception of performance delays

[Untitled](Measure%20performance%20with%20the%20RAIL%20model%2091ebcb6baaa54140b0f9f8d711b5626c/Untitled%20Database%205b53d993f5e046929b38bb97e616b781.csv)

Users perceive performance delays differently, depending on network conditions and hardware. For example, loading sites on a powerful desktop machine over a fast Wi-Fi connection commonly happens in under 1 s and users have grown accustomed to that. Loading sites on mobile devices with slow 3G connections takes more time, so mobile users are generally more patient and loading in 5 s on mobile is a more realistic goal.

## Goals and guidelines [#](https://web.dev/rail/#goals-and-guidelines)

In the context of RAIL, the terms **goals** and **guidelines** have specific meanings:

- **Goals**. Key performance metrics related to user experience. For example, tap to paint in under 100 milliseconds. Since human perception is relatively constant, these goals are unlikely to change any time soon.
- **Guidelines**. Recommendations that help you achieve goals. These may be specific to current hardware and network connection conditions, and therefore may change over time.

## Response: process events in under 50ms [#](https://web.dev/rail/#response-process-events-in-under-50ms)

**Goal**: Complete a transition initiated by user input within 100 ms, so users feel like the interactions are instantaneous.

**Guidelines**:

- To ensure a visible response within 100 ms, process user input events within 50 ms. This applies to most inputs, such as clicking buttons, toggling form controls, or starting animations. This does not apply to touch drags or scrolls.
- Though it may sound counterintuitive, it's not always the right call to respond to user input immediately. You can use this 100 ms window to do other expensive work, but be careful not to block the user. If possible, do work in the background.
- For actions that take longer than 50 ms to complete, always provide feedback.

The goal is to respond to input in under 100 ms, so why is our budget only 50 ms? This is because there is generally other work being done in addition to input handling, and that work takes up part of the time available for acceptable input response. If an application is performing work in the recommended 50 ms chunks during idle time, that means input can be queued for up to 50 ms if it occurs during one of those chunks of work. Accounting for this, it's safe to assume only the remaining 50 ms is available for actual input handling. This effect is visualized in the diagram below which shows how input received during an idle task is queued, reducing the available processing time:

How idle tasks affect input response budget.

## Animation: produce a frame in 10 ms [#](https://web.dev/rail/#animation-produce-a-frame-in-10-ms)

**Goals**:

- Produce each frame in an animation in 10 ms or less. Technically, the maximum budget for each frame is 16 ms (1000 ms / 60 frames per second â‰ˆ 16 ms), but browsers need about 6 ms to render each frame, hence the guideline of 10 ms per frame.
- Aim for visual smoothness. Users notice when frame rates vary.

**Guidelines**:

- In high pressure points like animations, the key is to do nothing where you can, and the absolute minimum where you can't. Whenever possible, make use of the 100 ms response to pre-calculate expensive work so that you maximize your chances of hitting 60 fps.
- See [Rendering Performance](https://web.dev/rendering-performance/) for various animation optimization strategies.

Recognize all the types of animations. Animations aren't just fancy UI effects. Each of these interactions are considered animations: * Visual animations, such as entrances and exits, [tweens](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/T/tweening.html), and loading indicators. * Scrolling. This includes flinging, which is when the user starts scrolling, then lets go, and the page continues scrolling. * Dragging. Animations often follow user interactions, such as panning a map or pinching to zoom.

## Idle: maximize idle time [#](https://web.dev/rail/#idle-maximize-idle-time)

**Goal**: Maximize idle time to increase the odds that the page responds to user input within 50 ms.

**Guidelines**:

- Use idle time to complete deferred work. For example, for the initial page load, load as little data as possible, then use [idle time](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback) to load the rest.
- Perform work during idle time in 50 ms or less. Any longer, and you risk interfering with the app's ability to respond to user input within 50 ms.
- If a user interacts with a page during idle time work, the user interaction should always take the highest priority and interrupt the idle time work.

## Load: deliver content and become interactive in under 5 seconds [#](https://web.dev/rail/#load-deliver-content-and-become-interactive-in-under-5-seconds)

When pages load slowly, user attention wanders, and users perceive the task as broken. Sites that load quickly have [longer average sessions, lower bounce rates, and higher ad viewability](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-154/insights-inspiration/research-data/need-mobile-speed-how-mobile-latency-impacts-publisher-revenue/).

**Goals**:

- Optimize for fast loading performance relative to the device and network capabilities of your users. Currently, a good target for first loads is to load the page and be [interactive](https://web.dev/tti/) in [5 seconds or less on mid-range mobile devices with slow 3G connections](https://web.dev/performance-budgets-101/#establish-a-baseline).
- For subsequent loads, a good target is to load the page in under 2 seconds.

Be aware that these targets may change over time.

**Guidelines**:

- Test your load performance on the mobile devices and network connections that are common among your users. You can use [Chrome User Experience Report](https://web.dev/chrome-ux-report/) to find out the [connection distribution](https://web.dev/chrome-ux-report-data-studio-dashboard/#using-the-dashboard) of your users. If the data is not available for your site, [The Mobile Economy 2019](https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/) suggests that a good global baseline is a mid-range Android phone, such as a Moto G4, and a slow 3G network (defined as 400 ms RTT and 400 kbps transfer speed). This combination is available on [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/easy).
- Keep in mind that although your typical mobile user's device might claim that it's on a 2G, 3G, or 4G connection, in reality the [effective connection speed](https://web.dev/adaptive-serving-based-on-network-quality/#how-it-works) is often significantly slower, due to packet loss and network variance.
- [Eliminate render blocking resources](https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/).
- You don't have to load everything in under 5 seconds to produce the perception of a complete load. Consider [lazy-loading images](https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/), [code-splitting JavaScript bundles](https://web.dev/reduce-javascript-payloads-with-code-splitting/), and other [optimizations suggested on web.dev](https://web.dev/fast/).

Recognize the factors that affect page load performance: * Network speed and latency * Hardware (slower CPUs, for example) * Cache eviction * Differences in L2/L3 caching * Parsing JavaScript

## Tools for measuring RAIL [#](https://web.dev/rail/#tools-for-measuring-rail)

There are a few tools to help you automate your RAIL measurements. Which one you use depends on what type of information you need, and what type of workflow you prefer.

### Chrome DevTools [#](https://web.dev/rail/#chrome-devtools)

[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) provides in-depth analysis on everything that happens while your page loads or runs. See [Get Started With Analyzing Runtime Performance](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/) to get familiar with the **Performance** panel UI.

The following DevTools features are especially relevant:

- [Throttle your CPU](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#cpu-throttle) to simulate a less-powerful device.
- [Throttle the network](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#network-throttle) to simulate slower connections.
- [View main thread activity](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#main) to view every event that occurred on the main thread while you were recording.
- [View main thread activities in a table](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#activities) to sort activities based on which ones took up the most time.
- [Analyze frames per second (FPS)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#fps) to measure whether your animations truly run smoothly.
- [Monitor CPU usage, JS heap size, DOM nodes, layouts per second, and more](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/devtools-release-notes#perf-monitor) in real-time with the **Performance Monitor**.
- [Visualize network requests](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#network) that occurred while you were recording with the **Network** section.
- [Capture screenshots while recording](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#screenshots) to play back exactly how the page looked while the page loaded, or an animation fired, and so on.
- [View interactions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#interactions) to quickly identify what happened on a page after a user interacted with it.
- [Find scroll performance issues in real-time](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#scrolling-performance-issues) by highlighting the page whenever a potentially problematic listener fires.
- [View paint events in real-time](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#paint-flashing) to identify costly paint events that may be harming the performance of your animations.

### Lighthouse [#](https://web.dev/rail/#lighthouse)

[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) is available in Chrome DevTools, at [web.dev/measure](https://web.dev/measure/), as a Chrome Extension, as a Node.js module, and within WebPageTest. You give it a URL, it simulates a mid-range device with a slow 3G connection, runs a series of audits on the page, and then gives you a report on load performance, as well as suggestions on how to improve.

The following audits are especially relevant:

**Response**

- [Max Potential First Input Delay](https://web.dev/lighthouse-max-potential-fid/). Estimates how long your app will take to respond to user input, based on main thread idle time.
- [Does not use passive listeners to improve scrolling performance](https://web.dev/uses-passive-event-listeners/).
- [Total Blocking Time](https://web.dev/lighthouse-total-blocking-time/). Measures the total amount of time that a page is blocked from responding to user input, such as mouse clicks, screen taps, or keyboard presses.
- [Time To Interactive](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/consistently-interactive). Measures when a user can consistently interact with all page elements.

**Load**

- [Does not register a service worker that controls page and start_url](https://web.dev/service-worker/). A service worker can cache common resources on a user's device, reducing time spent fetching resources over the network.
- [Page load is not fast enough on mobile networks](https://web.dev/load-fast-enough-for-pwa/).
- [Defer offscreen images](https://web.dev/offscreen-images/). Defer the loading of offscreen images until they're needed.
- [Properly size images](https://web.dev/uses-responsive-images/). Don't serve images that are significantly larger than the size that's rendered in the mobile viewport.
- [Does not use HTTP/2 for all of its resources](https://web.dev/uses-http2/).
- [Avoid an excessive DOM size](https://web.dev/dom-size/). Reduce network bytes by only shipping DOM nodes that are needed for rendering the page.

WebPageTest is a web performance tool that uses real browsers to access web pages and collect timing metrics. Enter a URL at [webpagetest.org/easy](https://webpagetest.org/easy) to get a detailed report on the page's load performance on a real Moto G4 device with a slow 3G connection. You can also configure it to include a Lighthouse audit.
