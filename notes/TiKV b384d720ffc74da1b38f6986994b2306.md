TiKV is a highly scalable, low latency, and easy to use
key-value database.

[Get Started](https://tikv.org/docs/5.1/concepts/overview/)

TiKV provides both raw and ACID-compliant transactional key-value API, which is widely used in online serving services, such as the metadata storage system for object storage service, the storage system for recommendation systems, the [online feature store](https://www.featurestore.org/), etc.

TiKV is also widely used as the storage layer for database management systems, for example:

- [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb): An open-source MySQL compatible NewSQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads.
- [Zetta](https://github.com/zhihu/zetta): An open-source NoSQL database that supports Transaction and Cloud Spanner like API.
- [Tidis](https://github.com/yongman/tidis): a Distributed NoSQL database, providing a Redis protocol API (string, list, hash, set, sorted set), written in Go.
- [Titan](https://github.com/distributedio/titan): A distributed implementation of Redis compatible layer based on TiKV.
- [JuiceFS](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs): An open-source POSIX file system that is based on TiKV and S3.

With the [Placement Driver](https://tikv.org/docs/5.1/reference/architecture/terminology/#placement-driver-pd) and carefully designed [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) groups, TiKV excels in horizontal scalability and can easily scale to 100+ terabytes of data. Scale-out your TiKV cluster to fit the data size growth without any impact on the application.

Run a single command to deploy a TiKV cluster with everything you need for production environments. Easily scale out or scale in the cluster with [TiUP](https://tikv.org/docs/5.1/reference/tiup/) or TiKV operator.

TiKV is based on the design of [Google Spanner](https://research.google/pubs/pub39966/) and [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/), but simpler to manage without dependencies on any distributed file system.
