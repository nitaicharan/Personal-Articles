RxJS is the most popular framework for functional reactive programming (FRP) in JavaScript. This means a lot of people are using RxJS daily in their projects. Most developers are aware of the common clean-code practices, but what about RxJS best practices? Are you aware of the dos and don‚Äôts when it comes to FRP? Are you applying them in your code?

This tutorial will focus on several best practices that I use daily when writing code, with practical examples. We‚Äôll be covering the following points:

We‚Äôll be covering these techniques:

1. Avoid logic inside the subscribe function

2. Use subjects to force completion

3. Avoid duplicated logic

4. Avoid nesting ‚Äî use chaining instead

5. Share to avoid stream duplication

6. Don‚Äôt expose subjects

7. Use marble diagrams for testing

Without further ado, let‚Äôs get started.

Hello everyone, welcome to Dottech. In this video we‚Äôre going to talk about RxJS, which is the most popular framework for functional reactive programming in JavaScript. More specifically, we‚Äôre going to talk about RxJS best practices. We‚Äôll discuss the dos and don‚Äôts when it comes to functional reactive programming. So, without further ado, let‚Äôs get started

# 1. Avoid Logic Inside the Subscribe Function

This statement may seem pretty obvious to some of you, but it‚Äôs a common pitfall for RxJS beginners. Until you learn how to *think functionally + reactively,* you may be tempted to do something like this:

Logic in the subscribe function

Our `pokemon$` Observable emits `Pokemon` objects, and, in a *very* *nonreactive way,* we‚Äôre subscribing to it in order to access these objects and perform some actions, like returning early if the `Pokemon` type is `Water`, making a call to a `getStats()` function, logging the stats this function returns, and, finally, saving the data to the `Pokedex`. All our logic is inside the `subscribe` function.

However, doesn‚Äôt this code look exactly like something we‚Äôd see in the traditional *imperative* programming paradigm? Since RxJS is a functional reactive programming library, we have to say goodbye to our traditional way of thinking and start thinking functional reactively (Streams! Pure functions!).

So how do we make our code functional reactive? By using the pipeable operators that RxJS provides us with:

Using pipeable operators

Et voil√°, our code has gone from imperative to functional reactive with a few simple changes. It even looks cleaner, doesn‚Äôt it?

**Note:** I‚Äôm fully aware of the fact that a part of the logic (the `saveToPokedex()`function) still remains in the `subscribe`. I find keeping the last part of the logic inside the `subscribe` makes it easier for me to read the code. You are all free to choose whether or not to keep the `subscribe` completely empty.

The operators we‚Äôve used are pretty straightforward: `[filter](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/filtering/filter)` and `[map](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/map)` work exactly the same as the array operators they share a name with, and `[tap](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/tap)` is used to perform *side effects* (defined below).

# 2. Using Subjects to Force Completion

Memory leaks are a real danger when it comes to using Observables. Why? Because, once we subscribe to an Observable, it‚Äôll keep emitting values indefinitely until one of the following two conditions are met:

1. We manually unsubscribe from the Observable
2. It completes

Seems simple enough, right? Let‚Äôs take a look at how to unsubscribe from an Observable:

Manually unsubscribing from an Observable

As you can see in the above example, we have to store the subscription of our `pokemon$` Observable in a variable and then manually call `unsubscribe` on that stored subscription. Doesn‚Äôt seem too difficult so far.

But what happens if we have more Observables we need to subscribe to?

Manually unsubscribing from several Observables

As you can see, as we add more Observables to our code, we need to keep track of more and more subscriptions, and our code starts looking a bit crowded. Isn‚Äôt there a better way for us to tell our Observables to stop emitting values? Luckily for us, there is, and it‚Äôs very, very simple:

We can use a Subject, together with the `takeUntil()` operator, to force our Observables to complete. How? Here‚Äôs an example:

Using ‚ÄòtakeUntil‚Äô to make Observables complete

Let‚Äôs understand what‚Äôs going on above. We‚Äôve created a `stop$` Subject, and we‚Äôve piped our three Observables with the `takeUntil` operator. This operator is used to tell an Observable to stop emitting values, as soon as a different notifier Observable emits. Which means that our three Observables will stop emitting values when the `stop$` Subject emits.

So how do we make our `stop$` Subject emit? By calling the `next()` function on it, which is exactly what we‚Äôre doing inside our `stopObservables()` function. Therefore, whenever we call our `stopObservables()` function, our `stop$` Subject will emit, and all our Observables will automatically complete. Sounds cool, doesn‚Äôt it?

No more having to store any subscriptions and call unsubscribe? All hail the `takeUntil` operator!

# 3. Avoid Duplicated Logic

We all know duplicated code is a bad sign and something that should be avoided. (If you didn‚Äôt know that, I‚Äôd recommend you go and read [this](https://medium.com/better-programming/the-art-of-refactoring-5-tips-to-write-better-code-3bc1f6f7689) and then come back.) You may be wondering which scenarios could lead to having duplicate RxJS logic. Let‚Äôs take a look at the following example:

Duplicated ‚ÄòtakeUntil‚Äô logic

As you can see, we have a `number$` Observable, to which we subscribe twice: once to calculate the total value with `reduce()` and once to get rid of all the odd numbers with `filter()`.

However, our `number$` Observable, despite its name, doesn‚Äôt only contain numbers. As you can see, it also contains some dangerous falsy values, which can cause our code to fail. This is why we need to filter out these falsy values, which is what we‚Äôre doing with `filter(Boolean)`.

*Note: When using `filter(Boolean)` we lose type inference. We can avoid this by explicitly typing `filter`, like so: `filter<number>(Boolean)`*.

Seems quite straightforward, but ‚Ä¶

Notice how we‚Äôve duplicated the `filter(Boolean)` logic in both Observables? This should be avoided as long as our code allows it. How? By attaching this logic to the source Observable, like this:

Moving takeUntil logic to source Observable

Less code + no duplication = cleaner code. Awesome!

# 4. Avoid Nesting ‚Äî Use Chaining Instead

Nested subscriptions should be avoided at all costs. They make our code complex, dirty, difficult to test, and can cause some pretty nasty bugs.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a nested subscription?‚Äù you may ask. It‚Äôs when we subscribe to an Observable in the subscribe block of another Observable. Let‚Äôs take a look at the following code:

Nested subscribes

Doesn‚Äôt look very neat, does it? The above code is confusing, complex, and, should we need to call more functions that return Observables, we‚Äôre going to have to keep adding more and more subscriptions. This is starting to sound suspiciously like subscription hell. So what can we do to avoid nested subscriptions?

The answer is to use higher-order mapping operators. Some of these operators are `[switchMap](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/transformation/switchmap)`, `[mergeMap](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/transformation/mergemap)`, etc.

To fix our example, we‚Äôre going to make use of the `switchMap` operator. Why? Because `switchMap` unsubscribes from the previous Observable and switches (easy to remember, right?) to the inner Observable, which, in our case, is the perfect solution. However, please note that depending on which behavior you need, you may need to use a different higher-order mapping operator.

Using a higher-order mapping operator

Just look at how lovely our code looks now.

# 5. Sharing to Avoid Stream Duplication

Ever had your Angular code make duplicate HTTP requests and wonder why? Read on and you‚Äôll discover the reason behind this widespread bug.

Most Observables are cold. This means their producer is created and activated when we subscribe to them. This might sound a bit confusing, but it‚Äôs simple enough to understand. With cold Observables, every time we subscribe to them, a new producer is created. So if we subscribe to a cold Observable five times, five producers will be created.

So what is a producer exactly? It‚Äôs basically the source of our Observable‚Äôs values (for example, a DOM event, an HTTP request, an array, etc.) What does this imply for us reactive programmers? Well, if we, for example, subscribe twice to an observable that makes an HTTP request, two HTTP requests will be made.

Sounds like trouble.

The following example (borrowing Angular‚Äôs `HttpClient`) would trigger two different HTTP requests, because `pokemon$` is a cold Observable, and we‚Äôre subscribing to it twice:

Duplicate HTTP requests

As you can imagine, this behavior can only lead to nasty bugs, so how can we avoid it? Isn‚Äôt there a way to subscribe multiple times to an Observable without triggering duplicated logic as its source is created over and over again? Of course there is. Allow me to introduce the `share()` operator.

This operator is used to allow multiple subscriptions to an Observable, without recreating its source. In other words, it turns an Observable from cold to hot. Let‚Äôs see how it‚Äôs used:

Using ‚Äòshare()‚Äô to avoid a duplicated source

Yes, that‚Äôs really all we need to do, and our problem is magically solved. By adding the `share()` operator, our previously cold `pokemon$` Observable now behaves as if it were hot, and only one HTTP request will be made, even though we subscribe to it twice.

**A word of caution:** Since hot Observables don‚Äôt replicate the source, if we subscribe late to a stream, we won‚Äôt be able to access previously emitted values. The `[shareReplay()](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/multicasting/sharereplay)` operator can be a solution for this.

# 6. Don‚Äôt Expose Subjects

It‚Äôs a common practice to use services to contain Observables we reuse in our application. It‚Äôs also common to have Subjects inside such services. A common mistake many developers make is exposing these Subjects directly to the outside world by doing something like this:

Exposed Subjects

Don‚Äôt do this. By exposing a Subject, we‚Äôre allowing anyone to push data into it ‚Äî not to mention we‚Äôre completely breaking the encapsulation of our `DataService` class. Instead of exposing our Subject, we should expose our Subject‚Äôs data.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it the same thing?‚Äù you may be wondering. The answer is no. If we expose a Subject, we‚Äôre making all of its methods available, including the `next()` function, which is used to make the Subject emit a new value. On the other hand, if we just expose its data, we won‚Äôt make our Subject‚Äôs methods available, just the values that it emits.

So how can we expose our Subject‚Äôs data but not its methods? By calling the `asObservable()` method ‚Äî which basically transforms a Subject into an Observable. Since Observables don‚Äôt have the `next()` function, our Subject‚Äôs data will be safe from tampering:

Private Subjects to maintain encapsulation

We have four different things going on in the above code:

- Both our `pokemonLevel` and `stop$` Subjects are now private, and therefore not accessible from outside our `DataService` class.
- We now have a `pokemonLevel$` Observable that has been created by calling the `asObservable()` method on our `pokemonLevel` Subject. This way, we can access the `pokemonLevel` data from outside the class, while keeping the Subject safe from manipulation.
- You may have noticed that for the `stop$` Subject, we didn‚Äôt create an Observable. This is because we don‚Äôt need to access `stop$`‚Äôs data from outside the class.
- We now have two public methods named `increaseLevel()` and `stop()`. The latter is simple enough to understand. It allows us to make the private `stop$` Subject emit from outside the class ‚Äî thus completing all Observables that have piped `takeUntil(stop$)`.
- `increaseLevel()` acts as a filter and only allows us to pass certain values to the `pokemonLevel()` Subject.

This way, no arbitrary data will be able to find its way to into our Subjects, which are nicely protected inside the class.

**Note**: Please bear in mind that Observables have `complete()` and `error()` methods, which can still be used to mess with the Subject.

Remember everyone, encapsulation is the key.

# Use Marble Diagrams for Testing

As we all (should) know, writing tests is as important as writing code itself. However, if the thought of writing RxJS tests sounds a bit daunting to you ‚Ä¶ fear not. From RxJS 6+, the RxJS marble-testing utils will make life very, very easy for us. Are you familiar with marble diagrams? If not, here‚Äôs an example:

![RxJS%20Best%20Practices%2019594a3073cd4b68be6807591fb19e4b/02uN5I_Qj68MF3Ofd.png](RxJS%20Best%20Practices%2019594a3073cd4b68be6807591fb19e4b/02uN5I_Qj68MF3Ofd.png)

Filter-marble diagram

Even if you‚Äôre a newbie to RxJS, you should more or less understand these diagrams. They‚Äôre all over the place, they‚Äôre quite intuitive, and they make it quite easy to understand how some of the more complicated RxJS operators work. The RxJS testing utils allow us to use these marble diagrams to write simple, intuitive, and visual tests. All you have to do is import `TestScheduler` from the `rxjs/testing` module and start writing tests!

Let‚Äôs take a look at how it‚Äôs done by testing our `number$` Observable:

Marble testing with ‚ÄòTestScheduler‚Äô

Since deep diving into marble testing isn‚Äôt the goal of this tutorial, I‚Äôll only briefly cover the key concepts that appear in the above code so we have a basic understanding of what‚Äôs going on:

- `TestScheduler`: Used to virtualize time. It receives a callback, which can be called with helper objects (in our case, the `cold()` and `expectObservable()` helpers).
- `Run()`: Automatically calls `flush()` when the callback returns.
- ``: Each `` represents 1 milliseconds of virtual time.
- `Cold()`: Creates a cold Observable whose subscription starts when the test begins. In our case, we‚Äôre creating a cold Observable that‚Äôll emit a value every 1ms and complete.
- `|`: Represents the completion of an Observable.
- Therefore, our `expectedMarbleDiagram` expects *a* to be emitted at 20 ms.
- The `expectedValues` variable contains the expected values of every item that‚Äôs emitted by our Observable. In our case, *a* is the only value that‚Äôll be emitted, and it equals 10.
- `ExpectObservable()`: Schedules an assertion that‚Äôll be executed when the `testScheduler` flushes. In our case, our assertion expects the `number$` Observable to be like the `expectedMarbleDiagram`, with the values contained in the `expectedValues` variable.

You can find more information about helpers in the [official RxJS docs](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/testing/marble-testing).

Advantages of using RxJS marble-testing utils:

- You avoid a lot of boilerplate code. (Jasmine Marbles users will be able to appreciate this.)
- It‚Äôs very easy and intuitive to use.
- It‚Äôs fun! Even if you aren‚Äôt a big fan of writing tests, I can guarantee you‚Äôll enjoy marble testing.

Since I enjoy making all my code examples Pokemon-themed, I‚Äôll throw in another spec, this time featuring a `pokemon$` Observable test:
