The `tfswitch` command line tool lets you switch between different versions of [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). If you do not have a particular version of terraform installed, `tfswitch` lets you download the version you desire. The installation is minimal and easy. Once installed, simply select the version you require from the dropdown and start using terraform.
