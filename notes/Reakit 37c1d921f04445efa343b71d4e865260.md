[Reakit strictly follows **WAI-ARIA 1.1** standards. All components come with proper attributes and keyboard interactions out of the box. Learn more](https://reakit.io/docs/accessibility/)

[Reakit is built with composition in mind. You can leverage any component or hook to create new things. Learn more](https://reakit.io/docs/composition/)

[Reakit components are unstyled by default in the core library. Each component returns a single HTML element that accepts all HTML props, including `className` and `style`. Learn more](https://reakit.io/docs/styling/)

[Reakit components are built with modern React and follow best practices. Each imported component will add from a few bytes to up to `3 kB` into your bundle. Learn more](https://reakit.io/docs/bundle-size/)
