## Redwood is the open source, full-stack web framework designed to help you grow from side project to startup.

Our mission is to help more startups
 explore more territory, more quickly.

We begin by crafting a more integrated framework, 
beautifully weaving together the best parts of:

- We’ve chosen the world’s most popular rendering engine to power Redwood’s web frontend. With React, you’ll have your pick of learning materials, design systems, and trained employees.
- Optional TypeScript support gives you the best of JavaScript AND the best of a type system. Even if you build your app in JS, you’ll still get killer autocomplete because Redwood itself is written in TypeScript.
- If you design your components in isolation with Storybook, not only will you never have to fight with your framework to see it in a specific state, but you’ll also build up a comprehensive design reference for free!

On top of the technology, we warmly welcome you to join our community, because going from side project to startup is hard, and nobody should have to do it alone.

If you join us, you’ll be in good company.

## Design

Mockup, build and verify components in [Storybook](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/storybook), even in complete isolation from the backend. Work on design without worrying about data.

## Test

Whether it's TDD or DDT, Redwood uses [Jest](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing#redwood-and-testing) along with [mocks](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing#testing-cells) and [scenarios](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing#scenarios) to verify functionality on the frontend and the backend.

## Auth & Security

Lock down your front and backends with your own [self-hosted auth](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/authentication#self-hosted-auth-installation-and-setup) or integrate with nearly a dozen [third party auth providers](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/authentication). Verify access with [RBAC](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control-rbac) and [Validations](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/services#service-validations).

## Data & Transport

When your API is [GraphQL](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/graphql) you're ready for any client, from the browser to native mobile apps and more. Transform your data with [Directives](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/directives) and keep your business logic organized and reusable within [Services](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/services).

## Deploy

Deploy your app to serverless hosts like [Netlify](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/deploy/netlify) and [Vercel](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/deploy/vercel), build for [containers](https://github.com/redwoodjs/docker), or deploy to [bare metal](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/deploy/baremetal).

### When you start with a GraphQL backend server, you'll end up with the only backend you ever need.

- There's tension between shipping product and building a great development experience for the team. Redwood allows us to focus on product because the development experience is baked in.
