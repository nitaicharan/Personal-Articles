Flux is a set of continuous and progressive delivery solutions for Kubernetes that are open and extensible.

The latest version of Flux brings many new features, making it more flexible and versatile.

Flux is a CNCF Incubating project.

[Get started](https://fluxcd.io/docs/get-started/)

Flux enables application deployment (CD) and (with the help of Flagger) progressive delivery (PD) through automatic reconciliation. Flux can even push back to Git for you with automated container image updates to Git (image scanning and patching).

Flux uses true Kubernetes RBAC via impersonation and supports multiple Git repositories. Multi-cluster infrastructure and apps work out of the box with Cluster API: Flux can use one Kubernetes cluster to manage apps in either the same or other clusters, spin up additional clusters themselves, and manage clusters including lifecycle and fleets.
