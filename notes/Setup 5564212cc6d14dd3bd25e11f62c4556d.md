**If youâ€™re continuing from the previous lesson,** you can skip this page. Click the button below to go to the next page.

### Download Starter Code (Optional)

If youâ€™re NOT continuing from the previous lesson, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. This sets up a `nextjs-blog` directory such that itâ€™s identical to the result of the previous lesson.

Again, this is NOT necessary if youâ€™ve just finished the previous lesson.

```
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/navigate-between-pages-starter"

```

Then follow the instructions from the command output (`cd` into the directory and start the development server).
