Now you‚Äôve learned the basics of [Angular‚Äôs NgFor](https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/angular-ngfor-template-element) it‚Äôs time to take things up a notch and introduce some Observables. In this article you‚Äôll learn how to use Observables with Angular‚Äôs NgFor directive and the async pipe.

NgFor has a not-so-obvious feature that lets us will help us deal with asynchronous operations - the async pipe. The async pipe takes care of subscribing/unsubscribing to Observable streams for us.

Let‚Äôs explore how we can handle NgFor alongside the async pipe to subscribe to an Observable!

### Using ngFor

Here‚Äôs the data we‚Äôll be using as our source to pass into `*ngFor`:

```
interface Pizza {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

const getPizzas$: Pizza[] = [
  { id: "j8P9sz", name: "Pepperoni", price: 899 },
  { id: "tMot06", name: "Supreme", price: 999 },
  { id: "x9sD3g", name: "Sizzler", price: 899 },
];

```

And here‚Äôs where we introduce NgFor alongside perhaps another local [NgForOf variable](https://angular.io/api/common/NgForOf#local-variables) such as `index`:

```
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let pizza of pizzas; index as i">
    {{ i + 1 }}. {{ pizza.name }}
  </li>
</ul>

```

But Angular is *reactive*, this means it‚Äôs all about Observables. This pattern of Angular development doesn‚Äôt follow an Observable data source pattern. So, let‚Äôs bring them in!

### ngFor and Async Pipe

For this, we‚Äôll introduce [Observable of()](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/creation/of) from RxJS and demonstrate subscribing to an Observable stream via the async pipe and update our typings:

```
import { Observable, of } from "rxjs";

const getPizzas$: Observable<Pizza[]> = of([
  { id: "j8P9sz", name: "Pepperoni", price: 899 },
  { id: "tMot06", name: "Supreme", price: 999 },
  { id: "x9sD3g", name: "Sizzler", price: 899 },
]);

```

Let‚Äôs get the `getPizzas$` variable into our component:

```
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `...`
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  pizzas$: Observable<Pizza[]>;

  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.pizzas$ = getPizzas$;
  }
}

```

Our NgFor directive can now use the async pipe to subscribe to the `pizzas$` observable:

```
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let pizza of pizzas$ | async; index as i">
    {{ i + 1 }}. {{ pizza.name }}
  </li>
</ul>

```

It‚Äôs important to remember that using `| async` creates a subscription if the source is an Observable. Thankfully, when the component is destroyed the subscription is also managed and unsubscribed for us!

### NgFor Template and Async Pipe

When we think of NgFor, we should think of [NgForOf](https://angular.io/api/common/NgForOf). Here‚Äôs how you can use NgFor with the `<ng-template>` element using the async pipe:

```
<ul>
  <ng-template ngFor [ngForOf]="pizzas$ | async" let-pizza let-i="index">
    <li>{{ i + 1 }}. {{ pizza.name }}</li>
  </ng-template>
</ul>

```

This is the longer syntax using `<ng-template>` and explains why we use `*ngFor` with the asterisk, which denotes that it‚Äôs a *behavioral directive*.

Check out the live StackBlitz example:

### NgFor + NgIf + Async Pipe

So far we‚Äôve covered some really nice usage of NgFor with the async pipe, but now we‚Äôre going to show a common practice of ‚Äúunwrapping‚Äù observables on different levels of the template.

First, using [NgIf and the Async Pipe](https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/angular-ngif-async-pipe), we can do this:

```
<div *ngIf="pizzas$ | async as pizzas">
  {{ pizza }}
</div>

```

Instead of using the async pipe directly with NgFor, we could use NgIf to unwrap our Observable into a `pizzas` variable.

This would allow us to reuse the variable *multiple times* inside the template without creating repeat subscriptions:

```
<div *ngIf="pizzas$ | async as pizzas">
  <p>üçï {{ pizzas.length }} Pizzas!</p>
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let pizza of pizzas; index as i">
      {{ i + 1 }}. {{ pizza.name }}
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

```

This also means we can avoid using things like the safe navigation operator `?` with NgIf or NgFor.

Check out the live StackBlitz example:

### Summary

We‚Äôve covered a lot of ground here using Angular‚Äôs NgFor directive and the async pipe.

Starting with static data we then used Observable `of()` to create an Observable and async pipe it into NgFor.

From there, we looked at how we could potentially use NgIf alongside NgFor (and the rest of our template) to avoid subscribing multiple times to our Observable.
