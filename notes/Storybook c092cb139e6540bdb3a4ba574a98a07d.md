Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.

## Develop durable UIs

Storybook provides a sandbox to build UIs in isolation so you can develop hard-to-reach states and edge cases.

“Storybook is a powerful frontend workshop environment tool that allows teams to design, build, and organize UI components (and even full screens!) without getting tripped up over business logic and plumbing.”

## Test UIs with less effort and no flake

Stories are a pragmatic, reproducible way to keep track of UI edge cases. Write stories once then reuse them to power automated tests.

“The tool we use for editing UI is Storybook. It is the perfect place to make sure your work aligns with designs to the pixel across breakpoints.”

## Document UI for your team to reuse

Storybook brings together UI, examples, and documentation in one place. That helps teammates adopt existing UI patterns.

“Storybook has made developing components more streamlined by allowing us to easily include technical documentation within our design system!”

Stories show how UIs actually work not just how they're supposed to work. That makes gathering feedback and reproductions easy.
